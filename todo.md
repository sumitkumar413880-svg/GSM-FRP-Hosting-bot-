## Todo List

- [ ] **Phase 1: Research GSM FRP hosting requirements and Telegram bot architecture**
  - [ ] Research GSM FRP (Google Account Bypass) services and their typical hosting requirements.
  - [ ] Research common features of Telegram bots for service provision (e.g., user authentication, service listing, payment integration, admin panel).
  - [ ] Research Python Telegram bot libraries (e.g., `python-telegram-bot`, `telebot`) and their architectural patterns.
  - [ ] Summarize findings in a research document.

- [x] **Phase 2: Design bot structure and create project setup**
  - [x] Define the bot's command structure and user flows.
  - [x] Choose a suitable Python Telegram bot library.
  - [x] Set up the project directory and initial file structure.
  - [x] Create a `requirements.txt` file with necessary dependencies.

- [x] **Phase 3: Implement core Telegram bot functionality**
  - [x] Initialize the bot and handle basic commands (e.g., `/start`, `/help`).
  - [x] Implement user registration and authentication.
  - [x] Set up a basic database (e.g., SQLite) for user and service data.

- [x] **Phase 4: Add GSM FRP hosting specific features**
  - [x] Implement service listing and purchasing.
  - [x] Integrate a payment gateway (mock or real, depending on feasibility).
  - [x] Develop an admin panel for managing users, services, and payments.
  - [x] Implement a system for delivering FRP bypass services (e.g., providing links, credentials).

- [ ] **Phase 5: Test bot functionality and create documentation**
  - [ ] Write unit and integration tests for bot features.
  - [ ] Test the bot end-to-end.
  - [ ] Create comprehensive documentation for setting up, running, and using the bot.

- [ ] **Phase 6: Deliver complete bot code and setup instructions**
  - [ ] Package the bot code and documentation.
  - [ ] Provide clear instructions for deployment.
